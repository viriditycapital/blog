Let's set the scene.  You're a trader.  Whether or not that's a self-diagnosed condition or an actual job title, you say things like 'seeking alpha', 'find your edge', and 'passive income' as frequently as possible, for the sole purpose of making yourself sound smart and validating your potentially questionable life decisions.  And since most traders live in cities, you probably need a bike.  If you've ever shopped for a bike before, you know there are many types of bikes on the market, and choosing the right one can be overwhelming.  Fortunately for you, just as there are many types of bikes, there are many types of traders too.  We've created a definitive guide helping you choose the right bike depending on what type of trader you are.

### 1) The Investment Banker
You're an investment banker.  Odds are, you're fresh out of college and still think you're the shit, because [not many people last in IB longer than a few years](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/139375/nearly-half-of-junior-ma-bankers-at-top-banks-quit-within-three-years).  You need a bike that's as confident, pretentious, and stupid as you are.  You need a **fixed gear bike**.

And no, *not* a single speed bike.  Single speed bikes have brakes and let you ride down hills with your feet on the pedals.  Both of those things are for virgins, and while that might be an accurate fit for you, you spend too much time wearing Sperry's and bragging about your 'kill count' to project that kind of image.  And to top it off, after a 18 hour day getting fucked at the office, you can fuck your legs too on your ride home.  Just try not to crash and die because you have no brakes.  Or do because you probably hate your life. 

### 2) The 'Quant'

Your formal job title is probably 'Quantitative Researcher' or 'Quantitative Trader'.  Your job exists on a spectrum from mental math to research.  You took this job because whichever prop shop hired you showed you their free snacks and game room and made everything sound like working at a low stress tech company, except they offered you *way* more money.  Now you're stuck working 80 hour weeks doing math mere mortals can't wrap their minds around, and you're too busy and stressed to eat any of the free snacks.  They pay you a lot though. You've got money to burn, and you're used to being the best.  You should buy a $15,000 all-carbon maximally aero time trial bike.  Just like being a quant helped you be the richest, this bike will help you be the fastest.  And neither will get you laid.
